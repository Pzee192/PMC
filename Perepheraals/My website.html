<p>I am very glad i started this journey. <br>I knew it wouldnt be an easy one <br>owing to the fact that i am a novice and also in my mid 30's. <br>I have a lot of responsibilities and people who look up to me for their daily bread. <br>Combining this with work was surely going to a difficult one but i am ready to weather the storm. <br>I pray this doesnt give way to my responsibilities.</p>
