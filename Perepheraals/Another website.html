<p>I am very glad I started this journey. I knew it wouldn't be an easy one, owing to the fact that I am a novice and also in my mid-30s. I have a lot of responsibilities and people who look up to me for their daily bread. Combining this with work was surely going to be a difficult one, but I am ready to weather the storm. I pray this doesn't give way to my responsibilities.</p>
